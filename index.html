	<h3>About</h3>

	<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Caitlin Conley. I have just finished my M.A. in English literature at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>. 
My master's thesis examined the book history and textual changes of Helen Hunt Jackson's 1884 novel <em>Ramona</em>.  I am experienced in various types of editing, including copy editing,
documentary editing, and XML editing. I am also experienced in tutoring writing, library circulations, customer service, and teaching both writing and music. Right now I am working at the University of Virginia's
<a href="http://www.library.virginia.edu/blog/libraries/clemons/>Clemons Library</a> and for Professor Alison Booth's digital project <a href="http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu/>COllective Biographies of Women</a>.
I also volunteer for the <a href="http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/>Papers of George Washington</a>. I am currently looking  to work in a field in which I can use and continue to develop one or more of my passions
in English literature, book history, public history, writing, and editing.</p>
